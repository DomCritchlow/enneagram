  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This tool is for team communication and self-reflection only. It is <em>not</em> used for hiring, promotion, or compensation decisions.</p>
  <p><strong>Data:</strong> We store your responses locally to show you your result and to provide an aggregate team view. The name must be unique; pseudonyms are allowed.</p>
  <p><strong>Access:</strong> The team facilitator can access aggregate counts via an admin page. Exports (CSV) are also limited to the facilitator.</p>
  <p><strong>Deletion:</strong> After submission, you receive a one-time delete link (token). Use it to remove your data at any time. You can also contact the facilitator to request deletion.</p>
  <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Scores are indicative only. Results should be used as a starting point for discussion, not as labels.</p>
